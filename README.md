# usage_change_ITA
Code, data, and trained models for the r/italy COVID-19 Usage Change Corpus. A corpus was created by scraping text from submissions on the [Italian subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/italy) between Jan 30 and Nov 30 of 2019 and 2020. Scraping was done with [praw](https://github.com/praw-dev/praw/blob/master/docs/index.rst) and [psaw](https://github.com/openai/psaw.)

The data was analyzed with the method from [Gonen et al. 2020](https://github.com/gonenhila/usage_change) to detect short-term usage change in Italian between 2019 and 2020.
